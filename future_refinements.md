## Future Refinements

### Spelling Reinforcement Phase (Only if Initial Guess was Incorrect)
- Text-to-speech announces ("Correct! <WORD> is spelled W O R D. Practice typing it one more time"), ex: "Correct! spin is spelled S P I N. Practice typing it one more time."
- Provide a row of individual black-outlined boxes for the final spelling attempt
- Number of boxes matches the correct word length
- User types word one final time for reinforcement


### Welcome Screen
- Display game title "Spelldle"
- Show "How to Play" instructions

### Integrations
- **Word Bank**: Lessons will consist of words and example sentences will be stored in GitHub Gists and managed by a separate administrative application
- **Game Data**: Use Mavo (https://mavo.io/) library to record spelling attempts in Google Sheets for analysis, reporting, and later spaced repetition practice
